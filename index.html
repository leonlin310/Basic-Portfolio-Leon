        <p>My name is Leon Lin, and welcome to my page! This website will detail my journey as I jump into a new career
            as a Full Stack Web Developer. The goal is to create this and to see real progress as I progress through this
            intensive 6 month bootcamp. This webpage will also be a starting point for my portfolio of works.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I grew up in the Chicagoland area and have been living in the city of Chicago for over 10 years. My favorite
            sports are Ping Pong, Basketball, Skiing, and Running. I used to do these all the time, but now I do them
            occasionally. On the weekdays, I can be spotted roaming the River North area. On the weekends, I split the
            majority of my time traveling between Chicago and Rockford, where I spoil my nephews and niece. Feel free to
